I6 involves dealing with layout managers.  
- Make sure you design your components on paper first.
- Write the code for each layout manager type one at a time and test them before moving on.
- Many of the code sections you need to change will be labeled with a TODO comment.
- Make sure you resize the main frame for each tab to test resizing behavior
- Do you want some absolute minimum size?  You are permitted provided the minimum is "reasonable" (let's say < 100 x 100 pixels)
- Remember if you have things that are being clipped but you want to allow people to see all of it (like text), then scrollpanes are your friend
- I always use the following URL when figuring out my LayoutManager: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/visual.html
- This is NOT even close to being up to my usual coding standards but in the interest of time it will suffice.  Don't judge me too harshly. :)
- <More text to test the size of this component>
- <Even MORE text.>
- For this project, feel free to modify the code or just add to it.
